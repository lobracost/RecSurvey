Pandas are known for their low libido, and females are only able to conceive for two or three days a year, which makes reproduction difficult. However, two pandas named Yang Yang and Long Hui at Vienna zoo seem to have fallen in love with each other and mated several times – a rare event in captivity for one of the world’s most endangered species. The panda’s gestation takes up to 163 days, so keepers will now wait to see if the mating was successful.
