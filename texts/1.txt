A person filmed a video of a wild fox taking bread and meat from people and stacking it into a sandwich. This happened in the Chernobyl disaster zone. The clip, which people have viewed more than a million times, was filmed by Radio Free Europe journalists on a trip. In the video, you can see the fox stacking the filling between the bread into a big sandwich that can barely fit in its mouth while it shows no fear of the humans. The Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded in 1986, and Russia established a 20-mile zone around it.
