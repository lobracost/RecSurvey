Dozens of apparently highly trained gunmen besieged the streets of the Brazilian city of Crici√∫ma. The gang of about 30 criminals in ten cars strategically blocked access points to the city to prevent police from responding. They robbed and blew up a local bank and took six government workers as hostages. They occupied the city for roughly two hours, while the mayor of the city begged terrified residents to stay indoors. After blowing up the bank, the convoy escaped and left large sums of money scattered across the streets. Some locals rushed to grab some of the cash that the attackers had left behind.
