While on safari in South Africa, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the American actor known for playing the Terminator, had a very close encounter with an elephant. Someone filmed a video of the elephant getting a little too close to the car, which he shared with his 5.4 million followers on Instagram just after it happened. The dramatic meeting, however, did not put him off elephants. He tweeted that he is in awe of them and wishes people would stop killing them for their ivory and to take a photo instead of a shot.
