On the Isle of Wight, which is just off the south coast of England, the one and only National Poo Museum opened. It has 20 different varieties of waste on display, ranging from the ones that we are more used to dealing with to a whole lot of animal dung. The co-founder of the museum is somewhat of a poo enthusiast and during an interview, he retold the time that he and his friends were in the wilds of Northern Sweden. There they came across a poo, but they were unable to identify it. He noticed how excited everyone became. Apart from the fascination, there is actually a scientific reason to study poo. An education and conservation officer from the Isle of Wight Zoo explained that scientists use it for health screening, looking for parasites, or monitoring the chemicals within. In order to take the poo in the resin, it has to be completely desiccated, which is a process that takes around an hour for insect poo and a couple of weeks for a lionâ€™s. The team even designed and built a special machine just for this job.
