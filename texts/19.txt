A mysterious monolith has been discovered in a remote part of Utah after being spotted from a helicopter. The pilot Bret Hutchings spotted the monolith when he was helping wildfire resource officers count sheep in the state. The metal structure is estimated to be between 300 and 360 centimetres high, and it seems to be firmly planted in the ground. The monolith was made from some sort of shiny metal, and it is in sharp contrast to the enormous red rocks which surround it. Hutchings said that the object looked manmade and some observers compared it to the plank sculptures by artist John McCracken who lived in New Mexico and New York until his death in 2011. Other people said that the monolith and its surroundings resembled a famous scene from Stanley Kubrick´s 1968 film ´2001: A Space Odyssey´.
