In Thailand, the founder of Chiang Maiâ€™s Elephant Nature Park likes to sing lullabies to the elephants to help them get 8 hours of sleep. The park covers 280 acres and is home to more than 70 elephants. Six years ago, a difficult-to-handle baby elephant was sung to sleep with success and since then, songs have been used to calm down the gentle giants and help them drift off into a much-needed slumber. Many of the elephants living at the sanctuary are rescue animals who suffered abuse.
