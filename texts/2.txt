Police Constable Hutton and hit team from England were involved in a high-speed chase when they used stinger devices to bring the car to a stop. The four young people in the vehicle started to run away, but quick thinking and one unusual tactic stopped one man from getting away. The PC was able to bark so realistically that everyone around thought that he had a trained canine with him. The policeman has been the subject of a fair few jokes since the incident, but who cares if people think that you are barking mad if it means that you get your man?
