French artist JR hid the 1980s glass pyramid which is the entrance to the Louvre Museum. He covered it in black and white pictures of the buildings that surround it, so from a specific spot in the museumâ€™s courtyard, it appears as if the huge glass pyramid disappeared. The French artist transformed buildings and neighbourhoods around the world with his work, turning streets into giant collages. In 2009, for example, he covered the Kibera slum in Nairobi with portraits of its women residents.
