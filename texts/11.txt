Libraries in Japan use machines that sterilize books using UV light. According to a Japanese information media for foreign residents, there are more than three million machines installed in public libraries throughout the country. It takes 30 seconds to sterilize a book and it turns the pages to clear out dust. Visitors can use the machine once they have borrowed a book and then again upon its return. Sterilizing machines give visitors reassurance to take out publications during the coronavirus pandemic; however, it is not required to use them. Although some libraries had a machine installed in 2018, they are now being used three times as much. Many of librariesÂ´ patrons are elderly, and so keeping them safe is extra important. Japan has avoided a vast number of COVID-19 cases and deaths; however, the country is now experiencing a third wave.
