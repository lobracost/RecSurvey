The US retail giant Amazon is facing pressure in Germany, the company´s biggest market outside the US. Trade union Verdi called on workers at seven German Amazon warehouses to go on a three-day strike. However, the strike would coincide with ´Black Friday´ discount shopping sales on November 27. The strike is scheduled to begin with Wednesday´s night shift, with Verdi demanding better pay and working conditions. Verdi has been organizing strikes at Amazon Germany since 2013. An Amazon spokesman said earlier this month that the company offered excellent salaries and that benefits and working conditions were comparable with other companies. Amazon´s sales have soared globally as coronavirus restrictions have forced consumers to shop online. According to Verdi, this has strengthened the case for higher wages and the necessity to protect Amazon´s workers more sufficiently against the spread of the coronavirus.
