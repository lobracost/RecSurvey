A series of explosions preceded the latest eruption of Europe´s highest active volcano, Mount Etna. The Italian volcano is located near Catania, the second largest city on the island of Sicily. Mount Etna erupted this week, sending a cloud of ash and spewing fountains of lava into the air; however, local authorities reported no danger to the towns situated on the volcano´s slopes. With a height of 3,326 meters, Mount Etna is by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Mount Etna is one of the world´s most active volcanoes, and it is in an almost constant state of activity. The most recent eruption on December 24, 2018, was followed by an earthquake that shook Catania, damaged buildings, and injured four people.
