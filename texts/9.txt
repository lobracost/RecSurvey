The only total solar eclipse of 2020 blinded spectators in South America on Monday. The eclipse was visible in Chile and Argentina, and as it happened during the Southern Hemisphere´s summertime, and closer to midday, the sun was located high in the sky. Spectators eagerly awaited the event, many prepared with face masks and solar-viewing glasses. Despite the changing overcast conditions, they hoped to get the best view of the incredible celestial event. Viewers in southern Chile received about two minutes of totality, and although the sky remained overcast, the coronal ring of the total eclipse was visible. A total solar eclipse on Earth is the result of Earth´s moon being the right distance from the planet and the right size to be able to block out the entire disk of the sun. Also, to be able to view the eclipse, the sky needs to be fairly clear.
