A 22-year-old man from New Jersey, US, has undergone the worldÂ´s first face and double hand transplant. In 2018, Joe DiMeo was severely burned in a horrific car crash, suffering burns on over 80%    of his body. He had extensive injuries, including amputated fingertips, facial scarring, and no lips and eyelids. He was in a coma for three and a half months, and then he spent a month waking up and trying to exercise a little. The reconstructive plastic surgery was carried out by a team of 140 staff at a hospital in New York, and it took 23 hours. It included transplanting both hands and the full face of a single donor simultaneously and it marked the first successful combination transplant case of its kind. After the surgery, DiMeo said that there were always a thousand ways to be sad about something, but there were always a million ways to be happy.
